Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) being the most prevalent subtype.

Accurately identifying and classifying breast cancer subtypes is a critical clinical task, and automated approaches offer the potential to improve accuracy by utilizing machine learning models to learn patterns, thereby reducing human error. I developed a few classifiers, including Logistic Regression, RandomForest, and Decision Tree, for precise breast cancer cell detection in histopathological images, enabling real-time alerts for physicians on potential IDC cases. 

Next steps: Improve the scores of the models through further hyperparameter tuning. 



To run project:
  1. Pip install pyspark & opendatasets
  2. Run the following commands to download the dataset:

  4. You will be prompted to provide Kaggle credentials to access the dataset. For the Kaggle username, enter 'divyakapur98' and for Kaggle key, enter '2eb3f0af2d1573ead9907f030017bf2d'. It should take about 2 minutes to download the dataset
  5. The main block of code is where all the preprocessing & classification is done. Some visualizations of the training set can be generated by uncommenting the following lines:
