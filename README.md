# invasive-ductal-carcinoma-detection
Developed ML models for precise breast cancer cell detection in histopathological images, enabling real-time alerts for physicians on potential IDC cases

To run project:
  1. Pip install pyspark & opendatasets
  2. Run the following commands to download the dataset:

  4. You will be prompted to provide Kaggle credentials to access the dataset. For the Kaggle username, enter 'divyakapur98' and for Kaggle key, enter '2eb3f0af2d1573ead9907f030017bf2d'. It should take about 2 minutes to download the dataset
  5. The main block of code is where all the preprocessing & classification is done. Some visualizations of the training set can be generated by uncommenting the following lines:
